				<h3>ACTIVA 5G</h3>
				<p style="font-style: italic;">The famed Activa 5G will meet its demise once BS6 emission norms kick in on April 1, 2020. It will, however, be survived by the new Activa 6G, which will hopefully rake in more numbers for the brand. The last remaining units of the Activa 5G are still on sale at a starting price of Rs 55,934. The Deluxe version will set you back by Rs 57,799 (both ex-showroom, prices). It’s available in eight colours: yellow, brown, grey, black, silver, white, red, and blue.</p>

				<h3>ACTIVA 6G</h3>
				<p style="font-style: italic;">The Honda Activa 6G doesn’t seem to have made a perfect start as the 110cc scooter was recalled for a faulty rear suspension bushing. Head here to know if your scooter is affected.

Honda launched the BS6-compliant version of India’s most popular scooter in January, and it has received a minor price hike as well. The base Activa 6G is priced at Rs Rs 64,464 which makes it nearly Rs 8,500 more expensive than its predecessor, the Activa 5G. </p>

				<h3>HONDA DIO</h3>
				<p style="font-style: italic;">Honda has hiked the prices of the Dio BS6 and updated it on its website. The bike is now pricier by Rs 553. The Dio STD variant now retails for Rs 60,542 and the Dio DLX variant for Rs 63,892.

The Honda Dio BS6 was recalled for a faulty rear suspension bushing. The bushing has been found to leak oil onto the rear tyre, which can cause a safety hazard. Head here to know if your scooter is affected.</p>
